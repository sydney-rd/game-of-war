# Game-of-War

A simple card game, typically played by two players. The objective
of the game is to win all of the cards. The deck will be divided evenly amongst players. Each player will reveal the top card from their deck and the player with the higher card takes both and places behind their stack

WAR happens when both players draw a card of equal value. Players will then place three cards, face down, and one more card - face up. The player with the highest card, takes both piles 

A winner is announced when ome player has 0 cards and the other, all 52
